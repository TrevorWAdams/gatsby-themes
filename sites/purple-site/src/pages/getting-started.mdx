# Getting Started

```sh
npm i theme-ui @emotion/core @mdx-js/react
```

Any styles in your app can reference values from the global `theme` object.
To provide the theme in context,
wrap your application with the `ThemeProvider` component and pass in a custom `theme` object.

```jsx
// basic usage
import React from 'react'
import { ThemeProvider } from 'theme-ui'
import theme from './theme'

export default props => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>{props.children}</ThemeProvider>
)
```

The `theme` object follows the System UI [Theme Specification](/theme-spec),
which lets you define custom color palettes, typographic scales, fonts, and more.

```js
// example theme.js
export default {
  fonts: {
    body: 'system-ui, sans-serif',
    heading: '"Avenir Next", sans-serif',
    monospace: 'Menlo, monospace',
  },
  colors: {
    text: '#000',
    background: '#fff',
    primary: '#33e',
  },
}
```

## `sx` prop

The `sx` prop works similarly to Emotion's `css` prop, accepting style objects to add CSS directly to an element in JSX, but includes extra theme-aware functionality.
Using the `sx` prop for styles means that certain properties can reference values defined in your `theme` object.
This is intended to make keeping styles consistent throughout your app the easy thing to do.

The `sx` prop only works in modules that have defined a custom pragma at the top of the file, which replaces the default `React.createElement` function.
This means you can control which modules in your application opt into this feature without the need for a Babel plugin or additional configuration.

```jsx
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx } from 'theme-ui'

export default props => (
  <div
    sx={{
      fontWeight: 'bold',
      fontSize: 4, // picks up value from `theme.fontSizes[4]`
      color: 'primary', // picks up value from `theme.colors.primary`
    }}
  >
    Hello
  </div>
)
```

Under the hood, this uses the [`@styled-system/css`](https://styled-system.com/css) utility and Emotion's custom JSX pragma implementation.
Read more about [how the custom pragma works](/how-it-works/#jsx-pragma).

## Responsive styles

The `sx` prop also supports using arrays as values to change properties responsively with a mobile-first approach.
This API originated in [Styled System][] and is intended as a terser syntax for applying responsive styles across a singular dimension.

```jsx
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx } from 'theme-ui'

export default props => (
  <div
    sx={{
      // applies width 100% to all viewport widths,
      // width 50% above the first breakpoint,
      // and 25% above the next breakpoint
      width: ['100%', '50%', '25%'],
    }}
  />
)
```
