# Presets

Theme UI includes optional presets that can be used as examples or as a starting point for extending your own themes.

```sh
npm i @theme-ui/presets
```

```jsx
// example theme
import { funk } from '@theme-ui/presets'

export default {
  ...funk,
  styles: {
    ...funk,
  },
}
```

To view an example of the built-in presets, see the [Demo](/demo).

Currently, the following presets are available for use:

- `base`
- `funk`
- `future`
- `roboto`
- `bootstrap`
- `bulma` (WIP)

## Contributing

We'd love to have more presets added to the Theme UI project.
If you'd like to add a new preset or improve upon the existing ones, please open an [issue][] or [pull request][].
